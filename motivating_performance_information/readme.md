#Motivating performance information

Motivating performance information is the information that healthcare professionals seek when viewing a performance dashboard or feedback report, to interpret their performance data. This including comparisons, trends, acheivements, and losses that can guide future efforts to improve or sustain performance. We have developed a set of functions that annotate performance information with the motivating performance information for any feedback recipient.
