# Feedback Tailor Knowledge Base

The Feedback Tailor Knowledge Base is a set of theoretical statements about how performance feedback messages influence behavior. The statements describe causal pathway models (i.e. logic models) that link the information content of performance feedback with its expected influence on behavior. The focus of the knowledge base is on the influence of performance gaps, trends, and comparator types as the key information content of feedback interventions.

The knowledge base can be used by a message tailoring system to identify information content in performance data that may be delivered in an engaging and motivating feedback message. For example, if a feedback recipient is performing below average (i.e. has a negative performance gap for a benchmark comparator), but is improving, (i.e. has a positive trend) these features could be used to determine the set of candidate messages that are available, given the causal pathways that depend on those features to influence the recipient's future practice.
