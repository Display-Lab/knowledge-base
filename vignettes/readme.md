# Vignettes for the Precision Feedback Knowledge Base


## Introduction
The Precision Feedback Knowledge Base has a collection of vignettes that illustrate how the knowledge base can be used by a precision feedback system to prioritize motivating performance information and tailor feedback messages. Each vignette uses a fictional context and providers, called personas, who are representative of some population of providers. The vignette includes narrative description of the function of a precision feedback system, as well as computer-interpretable code and files that can be used to test out the function of the precision feedback system. The narrative part of each vignette is written for clinical feedback system stakeholders, focusing primarily on a researchers and feedback system developers for feedback systems in health care organizations. The purpose of the vignettes is also to increase the findability and transparency of the precision feedback system software to all stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, patients, and communities.

Each vignette is organized around one unit of knowledge about how precision feedback messages can be influential and provide value for healthcare professionals' clinical practice. These units of knowledge in the knowledge base are written as causal pathway models that specify how feedback works, and which link relevant theories and other known factors of interest to researchers, to enable the use of the feedback system to contribute to the development of generalizable knowledge about how feedback works in healthcare organizations.

## Vignettes

## Context: Precision feedback emails in a quality improvement network
The vignettes are written for the context of a collaborative quality initiative in which a network of healthcare organizations share quality and outcomes data to learn to improve clinical practice and the health of patients.

### Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group
A healthcare quality improvement consortium called the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) uses precision feedback to prioritize motivating performance information about the quality and outcomes of operative cases. Precision feedback is an kind of feedback intervention that prioritizes motivating performance information and customizes its delivery based on the preferences of the feedback recipient, or that of their population segment. Emails with precision feedback about various performance measures are sent each month to anesthesia providers in approximately 35 healthcare institutions. One performance measure that MPOG assesses for operative cases regards the minimization of the use of climate-sensitive anesthetic gases: [SUS-04 : Fresh Gas Flow, less than or equal to 2L/min](https://spec.mpog.org/Spec/Public/63).

### Healthcare professional personas and healthcare organizations 

#### Alice, Attending Anesthesiologist
Alice is an attending anesthesiologist at Midwest Medicine, a medical-school affiliated hospital. She is motivated to continue improving her practice and that of her team, and who values setting new goals for her and her team to reach. MPOG has not yet elicited preferences from Alice about precision feedback. An organizational preference profile for anesthesia providers at Midwest Medicine has been developed from a cluster analysis of a sample of providers who have taken an online preference survey, and these results are used for Alice and any other anesthesia provider who has not yet taken a preference survey. This profile prioritizes feedback messages about changes in performance involving the achievement of peer benchmarks, drops in performance below a peer average, and improvement towards the peer benchmark, as well as time-series visualization in bar charts and line charts. The Midwest Medicine Anesthesia Provider Preference Profile is a set of relative utilities for attributes of feedback messages that a precision feedback system uses to prioritize performance information and feedback display format.

#### Bob, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA)
Bob is a CRNA at Danville Hospital, a community hospital. He cares deeply about the safety of his patients and the efficiency of his team to provide the best care for patients in his community. He is proud of his team's record of providing high-quality and exceptionally safe care, and the quality awards that his hospital has received in recognition of their exceptional work. Bob prefers to receive notifications about any potential quality issues or significant problems, such as adverse events, that may require special attention from him and his team. Bob prefers to receive these in a brief sentence that does not require him to look at a chart, but which helps him understand that there is some follow-up required to dig into the details of one or more operative cases. Bob took a feedback preference survey which generated a set of relative utilities for feedback message attributes that a precision feedback system can use.
