# DISPLAY Lab Knowledge Base

The templates describing the interventions and situations are all in the context of the recipient and potentially other performers and comparators.

## Intervention Situation Interactions (ISI)
A candidate intervention is the amalgamation of a situation and an intervention template.
This construct is a convenience for reasoning over situations and intervention templates, to make it so that a single now is being considered.

The ISI are located under the /mechanisms directory.
Each is described in natural language in the readme.md file, while the SWRL representation is in the json or owl file.

## Intervention Templates
An intervention template is the code and metadata for making a performance summary given performance data.

The templates are located under the /template-interventions directory
