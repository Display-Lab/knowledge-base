# DISPLAY Lab Templates

The templates describing the interventions and situations are all in the context of the recipient and potentially other performers and comparators.

## Intervention Situation Interactions (ISI)
A candidate intervention is the amalgamation of a situation and an intervention template.
This construct is a convenience for reasoning over situations and intervention templates, to make it so that a single now is being considered.

The ISI are located under the /mechanism directory.
Each is described in natural language in the readme.md file, while the SWRL representation is in the json or owl file.
