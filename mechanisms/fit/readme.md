# Feedback Intervention Theory (FIT)

## Description
Normative comparators like peer comparison or other standards ARE appropriate for "easy" or learned behaviors (i.e. those that are not associated with capability barriers in the recipient) because they do not result in significant attention being directed to the self, and can motivate the recipient to increase effort

Normative comparators like peer comparison or other standards are NOT appropriate for behaviors that have not been learned (i.e. those that ARE associated with capability barriers in the recipient) because they direct significant attention to the self and away from the task, which can lead to rejection of the feedback message, abandonment of the behavior, or changing of the standard

When the behavior is not "easy" or learned, displays that do not use normative comparators will be more appropriate than those that do. 

## ISI
- A display with peer comparison is more appropriate for learned behaviors.
- A display with peer comparison is less appropriate for not-yet-learned behaviors.
- A display without peer comparison is more appropriate for not-yet-learned behaviors.
