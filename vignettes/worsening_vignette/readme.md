# Worsening Vignette
## Introduction
This vignette delineates the process for creating precision feedback messages about a recipient's performance worsening month-over-month. These messages use the worsening causal pathway, which provides negative feedback that may motivate providers by delivering information about their recent performance falling below the past month's performance for a given metric. An example messages that uses the worsening pathway is "Your performance dropped this month for the measure [measure name]".

This vignette also contains examples of data features and other entities that a precision feedback system uses to evaluate the potential success of a precision feedback message. An example of such an entity is a [peer average comparator <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000126), which is defined in the [Performance Summary Display Ontology <sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/psdo) as an average representing the mean performance of a peer group.

## Performance Data
Each month, MPOG receives data about operative case quality and outcomes from approximately 60 healthcare institutions. MPOG calculates performance for each provider individually, for approximately 35 performance measures of quality and outcomes. One example of these measures is [SUS-02 : Global Warming Footprint, Maintenance <sub>(MPOG)</sub>](https://spec.mpog.org/Spec/Public/61).

### Benchmark comparators
MPOG calculates performance benchmarks and averages for each institution. One comparator is a [peer 90th percentile benchmark <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000129), which represents the 90th percentile for performance among providers at an institution, for each measure. Another is the [peer average comparator <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000126), which is the mean performance for all providers at an insitution, for each measure.

### Healthcare professional performance
Fahad, an attending anesthesiologist at Max Community Hospital, has the following performance data over the last 6 months for the SUS-02 measure:

|-----|---------|---|---|---|---|
|Jul  |      98%| 90| 92| 96| 90|
|Aug  |      98%| 90| 92| 96| 90|

|-----|---------|---|---|---|---|
|Jul  |      88%| 85| 88| 92| 90|
|Aug  |      88%| 85| 88| 92| 90|
|Sept |      88%| 85| 88| 92| 90|
|Oct  |      88%| 85| 88| 92| 90|
|Nov  |***86%***| 85| 88| 92| 90|
|Dec  |***80%***| 85| 88| 92| 90|

## Preference data
Preferences for precision feedback are elicited through a preference survey that providers can take. The preference survey produces a preference model for each provider that, with the provider's permission, is shared with MPOG to maintain. MPOG analyses preference data that is shared to identify population-level preference segments. These segments are generated as preference profiles that can serve as a default preference model for an organization, or which can be selected by providers who do not take the preference survey, but who identify preferences that are close enough to their own in the settings menu for the precision feedback system.

# Precision feedback message generation
To generate precision feedback, MPOG sends de-identified performance and preference data to a precision feedback system that processes each provider's data with their peer comparator performance data. The precision feedback system produces and evaluates candidate messages using metadata from message templates, then selects an optimal precision feedback message to return to MPOG. The precision feedback system is a knowledge-based system that is comprised of the following parts: a knowledge base, a software pipeline, and a web service.

## Precision Feedback Knowledge Base
The knowledge base contains the following components: causal pathways, message templates, and performance measures.

## Worsening Causal Pathway
This pathway describes the influence of feedback interventions informing the recipient that their performance is worse than that of the prior month. The causal pathway model is made up of preconditions, moderators, mechanisms, and outcomes.

### Preconditions
There are two necessary preconditions for the success of feedback intervention using the worsening causal pathway. They are subdivided into informational and message preconditions, and are as follows:

Information content preconditions:
1. [Negative performance trend content <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000100)

Message preconditions:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000119)

### Moderators
Moderators are factors that inhibit or promote the influence of the feedback intervention on the recipient. The social gain causal pathway has the following moderators:
1. `Message recency` - The number of months since this message was delivered previously.
2. `Message delivery count` - How many times has the recipient previously received this message in the last year? 
3. `Regulatory fit` - How aligned is the message with characteristics of the behavior/task, context, and recipient personality (motivated by prevention vs. promotion mindset with regard to future outcomes)?
4. `Gap size` - How large is the gap between the recipient's performance level and that of their last month's performance?

### Mechanisms
Mechanisms are factors that the intervention operates through to influence the feedback recipient. The social gain pathway has the following mechanisms:
1. `Awareness (knowledge)` - The message may change the provider's awareness of their own lagging performance relative to last month's performance data.
2. `Motivation` - The message may motivate the provider to work to increase their performance, eliminating the downward performance trend.

### Outcomes
The expected outcome of a successful worsening pathway intervention is clinical performance improvement.

## Message templates
Message templates represent a possible motivational message that a precision feedback system can send. There are two message templates that the precision feedback system can currently access for this vignette: 

The `Getting Worse` [<sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/getting_worse.json) message reads:
> Your performance is getting worse this month for the measure [measure name].

This message template `is about` [<sub>(OntoBee)</sub>](https://ontobee.org/ontology/IAO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000136) the following data features:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000045) 
2. Display format compatability: [Line Graph <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IAO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FIAO_0000573), [Bar Chart <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/STATO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FSTATO_0000166)

The `Performance Dropped` [<sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/performance_dropped.json) message reads:
> Your performance dropped this month for the measure [measure name].

This message template `is about` [<sub>(OntoBee)</sub>](https://ontobee.org/ontology/IAO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000136) the following data features:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000119) 
2. Display format compatability: [Line Graph <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IAO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FIAO_0000573), [Bar Chart <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/STATO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FSTATO_0000166)
## Software Pipeline (Precision Feedback Pipeline)
### Recipient annotation generation (Bitstomach)
The first stage of the pipeline is a script called Bitstomach. This script analyzes recipient's performance data and generates features called **annotations**. These annotations describe features of the performance data such as performance trends over time, or how performance measures relate to other values like peer performance benchmarks and institutional performance goals.

**Annotations for Fahad's performance data for the most recent month:**
1. `Social comparator content` [<sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000095)

### Candidate Message Generation (Candidate Smasher)
The second stage of the pipeline creates two candidate messages that may be appropriate for each recipient to recieve. It does this by searching through the message template library and selecting two message templates with annotations that match those annotations of the recipient's performance.

**Fahad's candidate messages (A & B):**

**Candidate Message A** is the `Getting Worse` [<sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/getting_worse.json) message template, which has the following annotations *in common* with the performance annotations:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000045) 

**Candidate Message B** is the `Performance Dropped` [<sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/performance_dropped.json) message template, which has the following annotations *in common* with the performance annotations:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000045) 

Both candidate messages have annotations matching those generated from Fahad's performance data, and are therefore appropriate as candidate messages.

**Gaile's candidate messages (α & β):**

**Candidate Message α** is the `Getting Worse` [<sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/getting_worse.json) message template, which has the following annotations *in common* with the performance annotations:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000045) 

**Candidate Message β** is the `Performance Dropped` [<sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/performance_dropped.json) message template, which has the following annotations *in common* with the performance annotations:
1. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000045) 

Both candidate messages have annotations matching those generated from Fahad's performance data, and are therefore appropriate as candidate messages.

### Candidate Message Preconditions Evaluation (ThinkPudding)
The third stage of the pipeline processes and evaluates the candidate messages for each persona based on preconditions. It compares the annotations associated with the message candidates and checks them against the persona's performance data annotations to determine which candidate messages are acceptable based on message preconditions.

For Fahad, **Candidate A** is acceptable by the causal pathway **worsening**.

For Gaile, **Candidate α** is acceptable by the causal pathway **worsening**.

### Candidate Message Moderator Evaluation and Selection (Esteemer)
The fourth stage of the pipeline consists of an algorithm which ranks acceptable candidate messages. It ranks these candidates based on applying weights to and then summing a number of moderators, with the end goal to determine which message may be the most motivating to provide to the recipient. The moderators which influence the rank of a candidate message are:
$$\text{Performance trend slope, }  \Delta_{\text{performance}}$$
$$\text{Performance gap size, }  G_{\text{performance}}$$
$$\text{Achievement or loss recency, } t_{\text{event}}$$
$$\text{Feedback history, } t_{\text{message}} \text{ and } N_{\text{received}}$$
$$\text{Individual feedack preferences, } F_{\text{pref}}$$

The overall algortihm can be represented as:
$$F_{\text{pref}} \Biggl[ C_{\text{data}} \biggl( \Bigl( X_s \| \Delta_{\text{performance}}  \| \Bigr) + \Bigl( X_{gs} \| G_{\text{performance}} \| \Bigr) \biggr) \\
    + \\
    C_{\text{history}} \Bigl( \bigl(X_e \cdot t_{\text{event}}\bigr) + \bigl(X_m \cdot t_{\text{message}}\bigr) + \bigl(X_N \cdot N_{\text{received}}\bigr) \Bigr) \Biggr]$$

<!-- No changes need to be made below this line when propagating to new vignettes-->
The Esteemer algorithm uses weighting coefficients, which vary based on the particularities of each causal pathway. For the social loss causal pathway, the weighting coefficients are:

| Moderator          | G<sub>performance</sub> | Δ<sub>performance</sub> | t<sub>event</sub> | t<sub>message</sub> | N<sub>received</sub> | Data component | History component |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Coefficient Term   | X<sub>gs</sub>          | X<sub>s</sub>           | X<sub>e</sub>     | X<sub>m</sub>       | X<sub>N</sub>        |C<sub>data</sub>|C<sub>history</sub>|
| Value              | 0                       | 0.8                     | 0              | -0.1                | -0.5                 | 1              | 1                 |

<!-- Values above need to be changed for each causal pathway -->
<!--

As an example, appropriate values based on this vignette are filled in for Eugene's **Candidate B** message, and evaluate like so:
$$F_{\text{pref}} \biggl( 1 \Bigl( \Bigl( 0.5 \| 6 \| \Bigr) + \Bigl( 0.5 \| 5 \| \Bigr) \Bigr) + 1 \Bigl( (0.5 \cdot 12) + (0.5 \cdot 12) + (0.5 \cdot 0) \Bigr) \biggr) = (19.5)F_{\text{pref}}$$  
Gaile's acceptable social loss candidate evaluates similarly:
$$F_{\text{pref}} \biggl( 1 \Bigl( 0.5 \| 7 \| \Bigr)\Bigl( 0.5 \| 1 \| \Bigr) + 1 \Bigl( (0.5 \cdot 12) + (0.5 \cdot 12) + (0.5 \cdot 0) \Bigr) \biggr) = (13.75)F_{\text{pref}}$$  
<!-- Equations above need to be re-evaluated for each causal pathway -->

Of note, each persona has more than one measure's worth of data, therefore for each persona there are potentially many acceptable candidates, utilizing different causal pathways regarding different measures. Esteemer evaluates each acceptable candidate measure with differing coefficient weights depending on the causal pathway. 

### Message Generation and Delivery (Pictoralist)
The fifth and final stage of the pipeline generates visual representations of the selected message based on the recipient's performance data, and sends this output off for delivery to the recipient.
The script takes in the selected message and performance data of the recipient as inputs. It then uses the recipient's display preferences to generate a figure that visualize's the reciepients performance over time related to the given measure and causal pathway. It returns the figure as an image encoded as a base64 string, alongside other elements of the precision feedback message. The precision feedback email is then created using this figure, the necessary text data, and is then sent to the recipient.
