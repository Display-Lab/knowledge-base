# Feedback Tailor Knowledge Base

The Feedback Tailor Knowledge Base is a set of theoretical statements about how performance feedback messages influence behavior. The statements are causal pathways (i.e. logic models) that link the information content of performance feedback with its expected influence on behavior. The focus of the knowledge base is on the influence of performance gaps, trends, and comparator types as the key information content of feedback interventions.

The knowledge base can be used by a message tailoring system (e.g. Feedback Tailor) to identify information content in performance data that may be delivered in an engaging and motivating feedback message. For example, if a feedback recipient has a performance gap relative to a peer-based benchmark, a causal pathway that depends on the existence of a performance gap to motivate improved performance could be identified as being available.

This project is supported by a grant from the National Library of Medicine: "A knowledge-based message tailoring system" (1K01 LM012528-01). This work is not peer-reviewed.


## Causal pathways

The causal pathways are located under the /causal_pathways directory.
Each pathway is described in a json file.
