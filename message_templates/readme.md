# Message templates

A precision feedback message template is a specification of the delivery of some performance information content to a feedback recipient. Message templates contain a key message and optionally a visual display. For example, a key messages such as "You have reached the goal" or "You are not a top performer" may be included in a message template with a visual display of a bar chart, line chart, other graphical display, or no chart at all (text-only).
