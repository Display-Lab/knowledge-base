# Goal Loss Vignette
## Introduction
This vignette illustrates the process for creating precision feedback messages about a recipient's performance dropping below an explicit goal comparator, which is a fixed performance benchmark in a measure, such as opioid use or post-anesthesia blood glucose levels. These messages use the Goal Loss Causal Pathway, which specifies feedback messages that are capable of motivating providers through the delivery of information about performance worsening. Motivation from these messages can arise from the recognition of a performance drop below a set standard, motivating the provider to provide extra attention to said goal. An example message that uses goal loss is "Your performance has dropped below the goal for this month".

This vignette also contains examples of data features and other entities that a precision feedback system uses to evaluate the potential success of a precision feedback message. An example of such an entity is a [goal comparator <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000046), which is defined in the [Performance Summary Display Ontology <sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/psdo) as a comparater which has been asigned a desired performance level for a given measure.

## Performance Data
Each month, MPOG receives data about operative case quality and outcomes from approximately 60 healthcare institutions. MPOG calculates performance for each provider individually, for approximately 35 performance measures of quality and outcomes. One example of these measures is [NMB-03-Peds: Neuromuscular Blocker (Initial) Dosing; Pediatrics <sub>(MPOG)</sub>](https://spec.mpog.org/Spec/Public/58).

### Benchmark comparators
MPOG calculates performance benchmarks and averages for each institution. One comparator is a [peer average comparator <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000126), which is the mean performance for all providers at an insitution, for each measure. For goal-based causal pathways, these peer-performance-based comparators do not impact the explicit goals that have been created, however they remian in the data processed by the pipeline, and are also shown below.

### Healthcare professional performance

## Preference data
Preferences for precision feedback are elicited through a preference survey that providers can take. The preference survey produces a preference model for each provider that, with the provider's permission, is shared with MPOG to maintain. MPOG analyses preference data that is shared to identify population-level preference segments. These segments are generated as preference profiles that can serve as a default preference model for an organization, or which can be selected by providers who do not take the preference survey, but who identify preferences that are close enough to their own in the settings menu for the precision feedback system.

# Precision feedback message generation
To generate precision feedback, MPOG sends de-identified performance and preference data to a precision feedback system that processes each provider's data with their peer comparator performance data. The precision feedback system produces and evaluates candidate messages using metadata from message templates, then selects an optimal precision feedback message to return to MPOG. The precision feedback system is a knowledge-based system that is comprised of the following parts: a knowledge base, a software pipeline, and a web service.

## Precision Feedback Knowledge Base
The knowledge base contains the following components: Causal pathways, message templates, and performance measures.

## Goal Loss Causal Pathway
This pathway describes the influence of feedback interventions that show the message recipient that their performance has fallen below an explicit performance goal, assigned independently of institutional peer performance. The goal loss causal pathway model is made up of preconditions, moderators, mechanisms, and outcomes.

### Preconditions
Preconditions for Goal Loss are factors that are necessary for the success of the feedback intervention using this pathway. The Goal Loss pathway has the following preconditions:

Information content preconditions:
1. [Goal comparator content <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000094)
2. [Negative performance gap content <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000105)
3. [Negative performance trend content <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000100)
4. [Loss content <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000113)

Message preconditions:
1. [Goal comparator element <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000046)
2. [Negative performance gap set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000116)
3. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000119)
4. [Loss set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000122)
 
### Moderators
Moderators are factors that inhibit or promote the influence of the feedback intervention on the recipient. The Goal Loss causal pathway has the following moderators:
1. `Habituation` - How many times has the recipient previously received this message in the last year?
2. `Regulatory fit` - To what extent is this message aligned with characteristics of the behavior/task, context, and recipient personality, with regard to motivation to avoid negative outcomes / problem (prevention focus), or motivation to achieve positive outcomes / develop and learn (promotion focus)?
3. `Gap size` - How large is the gap between the recipient's performance level and that of the social comparator?
4. `Slope of trend`
5. `Time since last achievement`

### Mechanisms
Mechanisms are factors that the intervention operates through to influence the feedback recipient. Adapted from [Carey et. al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kay078). The goal loss pathway has the following mechanisms:
1. `Awareness (knowledge)`: The message may change the recipient's awareness of their own performance and of institutional performance goals.
2. `Goals`: The message may create or reinforce mental representations of outcomes or end states that an individual wants to achieve, relative to their clinical performance.
3. `Motivation`: The message may give the recipient purpose or direction towards changing their own performance.

### Outcomes
The expected outcome of a successful goal loss pathway precision feedback intervention is clinical process performance improvement.

## Message templates
Message templates represent a possible motivational message that a precision feedback system can send. There are two message templates that the precision feedback system can access for this vignette: 

**[Drop Below Goal <sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/drop_below_goal.json)** message:
> Your performance dropped below the goal this month for the measure [Measure name]. Your performance was [recipient performance level as percentage (with numerator and denominator)], below the [comparator name].

This message template `is about` [<sub>(OntoBee)</sub>](https://ontobee.org/ontology/IAO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000136) the following data features:

## Software Pipeline (Precision Feedback Pipeline)
### Recipient annotation generation (Bitstomach)
The first stage of the pipeline is a script called Bitstomach. This script analyzes recipient's performance data and generates features called **annotations**. These annotations describe features of the performance data such as performance trends over time, or how performance measures relate to other values like peer performance benchmarks and institutional performance goals.

**Annotations for Fahad's performance data for the most recent month:**

### Candidate Message Generation (Candidate Smasher)
The second stage of the pipeline creates candidate messages that may be appropriate for each recipient to recieve. It does this by searching through the message template library and selecting  message templates with annotations that match those annotations of the recipient's performance.

**Fahad's candidate message(s):**

**Candidate Message A** is the [Drop Below Goal <sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/drop_below_goal.json) message template, which has the following annotations *in common* with the performance annotations:
1. [Goal comparator element <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000046)
2. [Negative performance gap set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000116)
3. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000119)
4. [Loss set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000122)

The candidate message has annotations matching those generated from Fahad's performance data, and is therefore appropriate as a candidate message.

**Gaile's candidate message(s):**

**Candidate Message α** is the [Drop Below Goal <sub>(GH)</sub>](https://github.com/Display-Lab/knowledge-base/blob/main/message_templates/drop_below_goal.json) message template, which has the following annotations *in common* with the performance annotations:
1. [Goal comparator element <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000046)
2. [Negative performance gap set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000116)
3. [Negative performance trend set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000119)
4. [Loss set <sub>(BP)</sub>](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PSDO?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPSDO_0000122)

The candidate message has annotations matching those generated from Fahad's performance data, and is therefore appropriate as a candidate message.

### Candidate Message Preconditions Evaluation (ThinkPudding)
The third stage of the pipeline processes and evaluates the candidate messages for each persona. It determines the ways in which the candidate message, causal pathway, and performance data are related, and ranks the candidate messages based on how closely related they are to the recipient's performance data and causal pathway. Overall, this script determines which candidate message is the best to give to the recipient based on the causal pathway and their performance data.

For Fahad, **Candidate A** is acceptable by the causal pathway **goal loss**.
For Gaile, **Candidate α** is acceptable by the causal pathway **goal loss**.

### Candidate Message Moderator Evaluation and Selection (Esteemer)
The fourth stage of the pipeline selects which message to use in this month's precision feedback message, and collects the necessary information for feedback generation. The script does this by evaluating three things: the recipient's message preferences, their message history, and the candidate message's acceptability based on performance data and causal pathway relationships (ThinkPudding output).

**For Fahad, Esteemer uses the following information:**
- The most acceptable candidate message is **Candidate A**
- Fahad's preference for goal loss messages is *Todo*
- Fahad has not recieved the **Candidate A** message recently. 
<!-- Todo - determine how long message cooldown is for repeat selection, change text above accordingly-->
> ∴ Esteemer will select **Candidate A** as the most appropriate message to provide the recipient.

**For Gaile, Esteemer uses the following information:**
- The most acceptable candidate message is **Candidate α**
- Gaile's preference for goal loss messages is *Todo*
- Gaile has not recieved the **Candidate α** message recently.
> ∴ Esteemer will select **Candidate α** as the most appropriate message to provide the recipient. 

For each of the selected messages, Eseemer will return the template ID, message text, comparator type, acceptability relationship, measure name, title, and display type preferred by the recipient. This data is used in the next step of the pipeline to generate the precision feedback message.

### Message Generation and Delivery (Pictoralist)
The fifth and final stage of the pipeline generates visual representations of the selected message based on the recipient's performance data, and sends this output off for delivery to the recipient.
The script takes in the selected message and performance data of the recipient as inputs. It then uses the recipient's display preferences to generate a figure that visualize's the reciepients performance over time related to the given measure and causal pathway. It returns the figure as an image encoded as a base64 string, alongside other elements of the precision feedback message. The precision feedback email is then created using this figure, the necessary text data, and is then sent to the recipient.
