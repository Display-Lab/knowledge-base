# Causal Pathway Test Suite
This folder contains input_message files developed specifically such that each file tests the particular causal pathway that they are named for.

## Notes and additional details
- All cptest.json files use the staff_ID 7, corresponding to Gaile
- Performance data is unchanged from vignette-accurate input_message.json files found in the personas folder on this repo
- Measure names are unchanged from input_message/vignette data
